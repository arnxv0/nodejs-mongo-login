   <h1 style="font-size: 50px;"> What is a sleep cycle?</h1>
<p style="font-size: 22px;" >
    A sleep cycle is a recurring pattern of sleep stages that occurs during a night's sleep.
     The sleep cycle is typically composed of four distinct stages: NREM1 (non-rapid eye movement stage 1), NREM2, NREM3 (also known as slow-wave sleep or deep sleep), and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. 
    These stages repeat cyclically throughout the night, with each cycle lasting approximately 90 to 110 minutes. <br>
    
    1.NREM1 (Light Sleep): This is the transition from wakefulness to sleep.
     It lasts only a few minutes, during which you may experience muscle relaxation and the beginning
      of the sleep process. <br>
     <br>
    2.NREM2 (Light Sleep): This stage is characterized by a slightly deeper sleep,
     and it accounts for a significant portion of total sleep time. During NREM2,
     your heart rate and breathing become more regular, and your body temperature decreases. <br>
     <br>
    3.NREM3 (Deep Sleep): This is the stage of deep or slow-wave sleep. It is important for physical restoration, growth, and immune function. During this stage, the body repairs muscles and tissues,
     stimulates growth and development, boosts immune function, and builds up energy for the next day. 
     <br>
     <br>
    4.REM (Dream Sleep): REM sleep is characterized by rapid eye movements,
     increased brain activity, and vivid dreams. It is thought to be crucial for cognitive function, 
     memory consolidation, and emotional regulation. The first REM period typically occurs about 
    90 minutes after falling asleep and lasts for about 10 minutes, with each subsequent REM period becoming 
    longer. 
    <br>
    <br>

    Throughout the night, a person goes through multiple sleep cycles, with the proportion of time spent in each
     stage varying. It's important to complete several cycles to achieve restorative and restful sleep. Waking up
      during a specific stage, especially deep sleep, can lead to feelings of grogginess and sleep inertia.
     The entire sleep cycle is orchestrated by the brain and is essential for overall health and well-being.

<h1 style="font-size: 50px">How Long is Sleep Cycle</h1>

<p style="font-size: 22px;">Your brain begins to slow down. You are lightly sleeping, drifting in and out. <br>
    Your eye movement stops and the brain begins to relax. This is a period of light sleep before you
     enter a deep sleep. <br>
     <br>
    Your brain waves begin to slow even more. They are preparing for the deepest stages of sleep.
    This is the deepest stage of sleep. It’s important for you to reach this stage for a good night’s sleep
     and it’s also important that you are not awoken during this stage. That will make for a very grouchy
      morning. <br>
      <br>
    This is the rapid-eye-movement (REM) stage of sleep.
     Most of your dreaming occurs during this time. Again, make sure you are not awoken during this stage because you will likely feel disoriented.
    BACK TO STAGE 1
    <br>
    <br>
    (hence the word cycle)
    Here you will start the sleep cycle over. This is also the best time to wake up and feel refreshed!</p>
